#Smile Detector

A computer vision project using OpenCV to detect faces, smiles, and eyes in real-time video.

Dependencies:

- OpenCV (cv2)
- Pre-trained face, smile, and eye detection data (haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml, haarcascade_smile.xml, haarcascade_eye.xml)

Usage:

1. Install OpenCV and import the necessary dependencies.
2. Place the haarcascade files in the same directory as the script.
3. Run the script using Python (e.g., python (link unavailable)).
4. The script will detect faces, smiles, and eyes in the video stream from the webcam.

Output:

- Detected faces are highlighted in green rectangles.
- Detected smiles are highlighted in pink rectangles.
- Detected eyes are highlighted in white rectangles.
- A "Smiling" label is displayed above the face when a smile is detected.

Key Bindings:

- Press 'Q' or 'q' to quit the program.

Note:

- Adjust the detection parameters as needed for optimal performance.
- The script uses pre-trained models, but you can train your own models for better accuracy.
